# PixelGreet
This is a bot for my upcoming livestreams, it allow me to have a bot greeting people with a single command, it'll fadein with the text:
"Hi Username, welcome to the stream"

I used javascript window.location and param so you can use it **like this**:

This project also use **Comfy.JS**, who lets you integrate with Twitch chat for your Twitch channel ***SUPER EASILY*** in just a few lines of code, it was made by:.

examples:
# *Here you need to specify your twitch channel otherwise the whole overlay won't work with your chat commands*

# *You can add a custom gif as an overlay character (default is my stitch pixel art)*
